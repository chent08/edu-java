/*
 * Shut The Box
 * ============
 * A dice game for 2 players or more.
 * Each player has stones numbered 1 to 9.
 * You have to shut (i.e., discard) all your stones to win.
 * A player rolls the dice and must shut stones that add up to the sum of the dice.
 * If he has no move to play, he is out. His score is the sum of his remaining stones.
 * After every player has taken a turn, the player with the lowest score wins.
 * If a player succeeds in closing all of the numbers, that player is said to have "Shut the Box" â€“ the player wins immediately and the game is over.
