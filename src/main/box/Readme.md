## Box
1. Add in Box.java another property **num** of type int.
2. Add and change code in Box.java as needed to support t2.
3. Add property *item2* of type T and add support for it.
4. Write example code in Main.java to use both *num* and *item2* nicely.
5. Define array of Box<Double> of size 10, and put random numbers in them in both num and item2.

## Pair
1. Create a new file Pair.java
2. Write in it a class Pair with two generic type parameters K and V, and a property for each of them
class Pair<K,V> {
3. Add method "toString()"
4. Add to main() code to create pairs like p1,p2 and print them.

Hint for main():

Pair<Integer, String> p1 = new Pair<>(5, "dog");

### Goodluck!
