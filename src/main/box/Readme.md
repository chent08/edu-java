# Box
1. Add in Box.java another property t2 of type int.

2. Add and change code in Box.java as needed to support t2.

3. Write example code in Main.java to use it nicely.

# Pair
1. Create a new file Pair.java

2. Write in it a class Pair with two generic type parameters: K and V

3. Add method "toString()"

4. Add to main() code to create pairs like p1,p2 and print them.

Hint for main():

Pair<Integer, String> p1 = new Pair<>(5, "dog");

## Goodluck!
